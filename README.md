# talon-videoconferencing

Systems for intelligently controlling videoconferencing software from within Talon (for example, implementing a a "smart mute" that automatically makes Talon sleep when you unmute, and vice versa.)

> **Note**
> Development is happening on the "work" branch since this isn't a finished project.

Currently supported systems:

* Discord (requires a bit of set up): supports a action to globally mute or unmute Discord regardless of whether it's focused, as well as perform a "smart mute toggle" (toggle Discord mute status and put Talon into the opposite state)
